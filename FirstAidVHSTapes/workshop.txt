description=[h2]Background[/h2]
description=Not sure about you, but I’ve always felt that the first aid skill was too difficult to increase naturally. Whilst I am aware you can simply roll around in glass shards and treat the wounds as they appear to help boost the first aid skill, it doesn’t seem very immersive... Would you do such a thing in real life to learn first aid?
description=
description=While there [i]is[/i] an official in-universe way of learning first aid, you need to find 2, hard to find ‘Home VHS’ and I’ve never found them in all my time playing! There is also no official, in-game way of teaching the player how to treat specific wounds. For example, crafting a splint to help fix a fracture, I only found out you could craft one by looking at the wiki…
description=
description=With that said, I decided to make this mod. Something that, with a bit of searching, allows the player to advance the first aid skill whilst learning the correct medical procedure on how to treat the injuries. (The procedures being the one found on the "First Aid" page of the PZ Wiki)
description=
description=I designed this mod to fit in with the other skill boosting VHS tapes such as Woodcraft and Exposure Survival. I would also consider this mod lore-friendly.
